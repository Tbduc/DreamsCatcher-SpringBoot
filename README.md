# DreamsCatcher (Version Alpha 0.02)
A new social media web application where users can share their dreams and get support from others to realize them.

I have implemented many features for the back end, but the most notable ones are:

-  Login and Authentication with Spring Security
-  Oauth2 and Login through Google
-  Various Controllers
-  Uploading images to the database, as we worked as a team of 3
-  Dreams Creation
-  Users' profiles
-  Dreamer and Mentor roles
-  Many unit tests
-  User entity and its child classes
-  Adding Avatars
-  Updating User Profile
-  Donation through Paypal
-  Refactoring of various implementation
-  At least 50% of entities and Dtos

1. There are many features left to be added, such as subscriptions to Dreamers' accounts with Paypal or another payment provider.
2. Also, we have a plan to add a dictionary where both dreams and offers have to go through content verification to limit certain words from appearing on the web app.
3. All e-commerce or account management features still need to go through the planning phase.
4. Search engine to find the dreams and offers based on custom algorithms.
5. Password management.
6. AI module such as a chatbot.
7. Integration tests are also in the plans.
